### Project Info- 

This project involves developing an advanced real-time detection system capable of recognizing multiple objects, hands, and faces within a video stream. Leveraging the YOLOv5 model for object detection, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and OpenCV Haar Cascade for face detection, the system efficiently processes video feed from a webcam. This project demonstrates the integration of powerful computer vision tools and techniques to create a versatile and responsive detection system. The project also employs CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration, ensuring the system operates with minimal lag, providing a smoother and faster user experience.
